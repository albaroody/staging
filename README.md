---

Laravel Staging allows you to **stage (draft)** Eloquent models and their **nested relationships** into a clean, separate system before committing them permanently to your main database.

- Stage parent models like `Patient`, `Post`, `Order`, etc.
- Stage related models like `Sales`, `Items`, `Comments`, etc.
- Hydrate full Eloquent models from staged data (not just arrays)
- Promote staged data to production tables cleanly
- Keep your main database structure untouched â€” no intrusive columns added!

Perfect for multi-step forms, draft publishing systems, and modular deferred saving workflows.

Usage


## Installation

You can install the package via composer:

```bash
composer require Albaroody/staging
```

You can publish and run the migrations with:

```bash
php artisan vendor:publish --tag="staging-migrations"
php artisan migrate
```

You can publish the config file with:

```bash
php artisan vendor:publish --tag="staging-config"
```

This is the contents of the published config file:

```php
return [
];
```

Optionally, you can publish the views using

```bash
php artisan vendor:publish --tag="staging-views"
```

## Usage
1. Add the Stagable trait to your model:
```php
use Albaroody\\Staging\\Traits\\Stagable;

class Patient extends Model
{
    use Stagable;
}
```
2. Stage a model:
```php
$patient = new Patient([
    'name' => 'John Doe',
]);

$patient->stage();
```
3. Load a staged model:
```php
$stagedPatient = Patient::findStaged($stagingId);

// Now you can use it like a normal model
echo $stagedPatient->name;
```
4. Promote a staged model to the database:
```php
$realPatient = $stagedPatient->promoteFromStaging();
```

## Testing

```bash
composer test
```
